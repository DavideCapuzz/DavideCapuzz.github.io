<p>
    In this article, I’ll introduce the robot platform we are using for the Robo Magellan Challenge.
</p>
<!--end_excerpt-->
<p>
    The robot's name is Whelee and it has been designed and built several years ago by the Central Illinois Robotics
    Club (CIRC).
</p>
<p>
    The robot’s design and architecture are crucial to its ability to navigate complex environments, detect objects,
    and make decisions in real time. Let’s dive into the specifics of Whelee’s design, including its mechanical
    structure,
    sensors, control systems, and power architecture.

        The Robot
    </p>
</div>
<p><b>Whelee Robot Platform Overview</b></p>

<p>
    The Whelee robot is a four-wheeled autonomous vehicle featuring both traction and steering capabilities.
    The design allows for excellent maneuverability, which is essential for navigating the unpredictable terrain found
    in
    the Robo Magellan Challenge.
</p>
<p><b>Mechanical Design</b></p>
<p>
<ul class="post-list">
    <li>
        <b>Wheels and Motors:</b> Whelee uses a differential drive system with two traction motors, one for the left
        side and one for the right. This setup allows the robot to create a virtual differential drive mechanism,
        enabling it to turn smoothly and maneuver with high precision.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Steering System: </b>Each of the four wheels has its own independent steering motor. These motors are
        controlled via PWM signals, allowing precise control over the robot’s orientation and movement.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Traction and Steering Integration: </b>The traction motors are linked to the four wheels via a belt system,
        ensuring power is distributed evenly across the robot for stability and control.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Sensor Suite</b></p>

<p>
To successfully complete tasks like navigation, obstacle avoidance, and mapping, Whelee is equipped with a range of
sensors that gather real-time data from the environment:
<ul class="post-list">
    <li>
        2D Circular LiDAR: This sensor provides a 360-degree scan of the robot’s surroundings, enabling SLAM (Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping). This feature is critical for the robot to build a map of its environment while simultaneously
determining its position.
    </li>
    <li>
        2D Long-Range LiDAR: This sensor is designed to scan longer distances, providing information about obstacles and terrain
far ahead of the robot.
    </li>
    <li>
        IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): The MPU-6050 IMU is responsible for providing orientation and acceleration data,
allowing the robot to understand its own movement and balance.
    </li>
    <li>
        GPS (Global Positioning System): The NEO-M8N GPS is essential for outdoor navigation, providing location data with high
precision.
    </li>
    <li>
        Camera: The Sony PlayStation 3 Eye Camera is used for object detection, which is crucial for recognizing obstacles or
identifying specific targets.
    </li>
    <li>
        Safety Bar: This is a crucial fail-safe for stopping the robot in case of emergency or failure, ensuring the robot
doesn’t continue moving unpredictably.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wheel Encoders: Simple optical encoders are used to track the rotation of the wheels and provide feedback on the robot’s
movement and position.
    </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p><b>Electronics and Control Systems</b></p>


<p>
Whelee's control system is made up of several components, which communicate with each other over a CAN Bus network for
reliable data transfer and synchronization. The architecture includes the following:

<ul class="post-list">
    <li>
        Raspberry Pi 4: The main processing unit and brain of the robot. It runs ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), managing the
robot’s tasks, algorithms, and sensor integration.

    </li>
    <li>
        Arduino Nano (Engine Control): This handles low-level control of the motors that manage the robot's movement. It
interfaces directly with the traction motors and steering actuators.
    </li>
    <li>
        Arduino Nano (Sensor and RC Control): This Arduino manages the sensors and remote control (RC) interface, ensuring data
from sensors like LiDAR, IMU, and GPS are transmitted to the Raspberry Pi.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Power Architecture</b></p>

<p>
Whelee’s power system is designed for efficiency and redundancy:

<ul class="post-list">
    <li>
        Dual Power Switches: The robot is equipped with two main switches—one for controlling the motors and one for overall
power management.

    </li>
    <li>
        Motors: Two DC motors are used for forward movement, with one motor controlling the left wheels and the other
controlling the right. This configuration enables the robot to execute differential steering.

    </li>
    <li>
        Steering Motors: Four DC motors (one for each wheel) are responsible for steering. These motors are PWM-controlled for
precise movement and direction.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Overall System Diagram</b></p>


Below is the schematic representation of the robot’s overall architecture, which illustrates how each component is
connected:

This diagram highlights the connections between the Raspberry Pi, Arduino boards, motors, and sensors, with the CAN Bus
network enabling communication between all the components.
